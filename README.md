# Experimental Robotics Laboratory assignment

## Introduction
This is a ROS package that simulates a simple Cluedo-like investigation. It uses ARMOR as reasoner and container of the ontology of the game and smach for the Finite State Machine behavior.

## Software Architecture

## Put Correct Paths
Go in "update_ontology.py" and put the path in which there is your cluedo_ontology in the global variable "path_ontology"

Go in "FSM.py" and put the path in which you want to save your solution_ontology in the global variable "path_save_ontology"
